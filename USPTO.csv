A rigid connection is present when no pivoting is possible about a fixed pivot axis. The rigid connection is also obtained when the connecting element is mounted resiliently in a holder. A rigid connection does not preclude an elastic configuration of the connecting element, in particular a bending elasticity. Such a connecting element is particularly suitable for use in what is called a knee-ankle-foot orthosis and serves to connect a foot part to a lower-leg structure, which is arranged securely on the lower leg of an orthosis wearer. Such an orthosis serves to support the apparatus of locomotion. The invention also relates to an orthosis device having such a connecting element.","p-0002","0001",NA,NA,NA,"description","The invention claimed is:","claims","EN","v4.5 2014-04-03","US09649215-20170516.XML","PRODUCTION","us-patent-grant","US","20170501","20170516"

Among other things, such apparatus usually include a safety line interconnected between a support structure and a person working in proximity to the support structure. The safety line is typically secured to a full-body safety harness worn by the worker. A mobile or temporary support structure including an anchor arm assembly may be used, and obviously, it is important that the support structure be reliable and able to withstand the forces of a fall. It is also desirable that forces of the fall exerted upon the person be minimized.","p-0002","0001","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","h-0001","1","description","The invention claimed is:","claims","EN","v4.5 2014-04-03","US09649516-20170516.XML","PRODUCTION","us-patent-grant","US","20170501","20170516"
